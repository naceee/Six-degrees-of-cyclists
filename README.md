# Six-degrees-of-cyclists

You've heard of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. Is there a pro cycling equivalent? For example, can you connect every post-WWII pro cyclist to two-time TDF winner Laurent Fignon in no more than six steps?  A couple of ground rules:  
 * A connection is made when two riders are in the same team in the same year  
 * A rider who retires and becomes a DS doesn't count as a connection on the new team: riders only

This program lets you choose not just one, but two cyclists, so you are not always stuck on Laurent Fignon. 

You can play with the program yourself, it is very simple, just download the program and the database, put them in the same folder and run six_degrees_of_cyclist.py.
