# Six-degrees-of-cyclists

You've heard of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. Is there a pro cycling equivalent? For example, can you connect every post-WWII pro cyclist to two-time TDF winner Laurent Fignon in no more than six steps?  A couple of ground rules:  
 * A connection is made when two riders are in the same team in the same year  
 * A rider who retires and becomes a DS doesn't count as a connection on the new team: riders only

You can play with the program yourself, by running six_degrees_2.py
